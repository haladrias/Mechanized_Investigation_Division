Armadura Stats

HP - (Hit Points, when 0 = armadura defeat)
StPw – (Short for Stopping Power, Weapon Damage, value = damage dealt)
Acc – (Accuracy, value = chance to hit)
Avo – (Avoidance, value = chance to dodge)
Tre – (Tread, Number of square an armadura can move)
Arm – (Armor, value = damage reduced)

=======================

Combat Math – to hit/miss

Primary pivot value = 10  ( if above 10 = hits, Below 10 = miss)

combat is determined by using random number between 1 and 20

add acc to the random number, then subtract the opponents avo 

Example:

	Player
	Acc 4, Avo 3  
	
	vs
	
	OpFor
	Acc 2, Avo 2

player gets a 12 then adds acc (4) to get 16, then subtracts OpFor’s Avo (2), leaving player with 14;  Since this is above 10, player hits.

OpFor gets a 10 then adds its Acc (2) to get a 12, then subtracts the players Avo (3); leaving OpFor with 9.  Since this is less than 10, OpFor misses.

=======================================

Formula = Random number (1-20) + Attackers Acc – Opponents Avo, > 10 (50%) = hit; < 10 = miss

Combat Math – Damage

StPw – Arm = Damage Dealt/Recieved
